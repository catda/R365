## Stretch goals
1. Display the formula used to calculate the result e.g. `2,,4,rrrr,1001,6` will return `2+0+4+0+0+6 = 12`
2. Allow the application to process entered entries until Ctrl+C is used
3. Allow the acceptance of arguments to define...
	* alternate delimiter in step #3 
	* toggle whether to deny negative numbers in step #4
	* upper bound in step #5
4. Use DI
5. Support subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
