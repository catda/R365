# R365-code-challenge

All engineering organization candidates complete the coding challenge at [R365 Challenge](https://github.com/restaurant365/challenge-calculator), no exceptions for EMs :)

To complete this challenge I elected to lean into R365's AI supported engineering ethos and use Claude 3.5 Sonnet. I chose to use test-driven development since the requirements included many tests, and the definition of a calculator really is the outcome of the tests. It was also a way for me to ensure that I was tracking the python code. I chose python because Claude said SQL would be very difficult and I'm currently enrolled with Udemy to (re)learn python.

In the claude directory I have included my personal profile settings, project settings, project content and exported the chat for full transparency.

My takeaway from this is that AI supported engineering works, and can be extremely powerful with the right prompts. Within an hour I went from no code to having working code. Most of my time was spent reinstalling VS Code on my laptop and setting up Claude for success.
